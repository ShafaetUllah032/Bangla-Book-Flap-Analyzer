# Classifying Bangla Book’s Context: A Multi-Label Approach

## Abstract:

This paper thoroughly analyses the multi-label classification of Bangla book content. We introduce a novel dataset of the Bangla book’s context, annotated with multiple labels, based on eight genres. Bangla is one of the most widely spoken languages and has an extensive literary tradition. However, the classification of book context data remained largely unexplored due to insufficient pertinent data. To overcome this limitation, we present Bangla Book Context, a large-scale dataset containing 10,211 samples categorized into eight main categories: fiction, nonfiction, mystery, tragedy, thriller, motivational, and romantic. For a proper evaluation, we employed three pre-trained models: bert-base-multilingual-case, BanglaBERT, BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Model and CNN-LSTM attention-based deep learning approach. However, the CNN-LSTM attention-based deep learning model consistently performs better than all the other models we have described.


## Project Overview
The Bangla Book Flap Analyzer is an innovative machine learning project focused on classifying Bangla book flaps into multiple genres using advanced deep learning techniques. By leveraging Transformer architecture and CNN-Bi-LSTM models, this project aims to provide accurate and insightful multiclass classification results, enabling in-depth analysis of Bangla literature.

## Key Features
- **Data Collection and Annotation:**
  - The project includes a meticulously annotated dataset of Bangla book flaps, ensuring a comprehensive and high-quality training set for the machine learning models.

- **Advanced Deep Learning Models:**
  - Utilizes state-of-the-art Transformer architecture and CNN-Bi-LSTM deep learning approach to build three robust multiclass classification models. These models are designed to accurately categorize Bangla book flaps into diverse literary genres.

- **Literary Insights and Analysis:**
  - Empowers literary researchers, scholars, and enthusiasts with the ability to analyze Bangla literature effectively. The models' precision in genre classification provides valuable insights into themes, trends, and patterns within Bangla books, fostering a deeper understanding of the rich literary heritage.
